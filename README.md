A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

Out of the 3 projects I could choose from GameHub is the one that resonated the most with me and what I could make something more out of.

Gamehub sets out to give people a platform to both buy and sell old and new games through the site, to lessen waste and to give you more of the value back than just pennies to the dollar like with a certain store.

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Installing

```
Clone the repository with GitHub Desktop
```

Or

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MartinP3/semester-project-2021.git
```

### Running

I suggest using Visual Studio Code for editing the code and running the Live Server extension if you wish to avoid breaking your F5 key.
